    <p>Welcome to my implementation of CS 493 Final Project</p>
    <p>You can start by logging in or creating a new account below.</p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>Users must be created manually if they do not exist as an entity already within datastore. In other words, if you are testing with accounts you are creating, their entities will not exist and you must manually send a POST request following the API spec to '/users' using Postman so that user entities can be created.</p>
    <p>If this is not done, ALL tests for protected endpoints will FAIL.</p>
    <p>So, please, once you create each user and login, copy the JWT and Unique User ID into jwt(1 or 2) and user_id(1 or 2). Then, to create the user entity, all you must do is a send a POST request to '/users' with jwt(1 or 2) in the authorization header (set to bearer token).</p>
